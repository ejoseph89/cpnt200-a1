## Project overview

- New project - static site that uses PHP `include` 
  - `_config.php` holds site wide variables
  - Repeating elements extracted and added to 'includes' folder
- Partials added using `include()`
- Dynamic copyright statement in the footer

## Comments

- I tired to make this site using Materialize CSS (failed, the learning curve was steeper than I expected)
- I wasnt sure how to add a class to the common nav file to highlight the "current" page
- Other than that, fairly straight forward
